# eda-readmission-shared

An exploratory analysis of anonymised patient readmission data, with a focus on identifying tangible next steps to take and questions to raise with a client (the data source) for building a 30-day readmission predictive model.

This work would then lead to an enhanced understanding of which patients are at higher risk of being readmitted, allowing healthcare providers to allocate the right resources earlier to reduce expenditure.
